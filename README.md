# payoutsBot
Discord bot written using the Discord.py API for the chat application Discord. Still work in progress


I am writing this Discord bot for use with one of my servers for the mobile game Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes. The goal of the bot is to track users payouts that are entered into the bot and provide a host of functions on command for displaying upcoming users payouts.

I plan on expanding the bot to include more functions for some of the other servers I used, but the current scope of the bot is to handle payouts.

THIS BOT IS VERY MUCH IN DEVELOPMENT. I am in my senior year of college so I work on this bot as I can.
